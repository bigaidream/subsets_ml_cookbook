# Gaussian Processes

## Current Understandings

As a probabilistic non-parametric framework, it can model middle-scale data very well. Of course, we can use a varieties of sparse (Neial Lawrence once argued that we should call it `low-rank`) approximation methods to enable it to handle millions of datapoints. But in the field, it does not seems capable of competing with deep neural networks.
