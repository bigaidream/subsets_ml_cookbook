I'm always trying to rebuild the models from memory, which is a killer exercise. 

## Workflow
All my external knowledge is stored in EverNote with Markdown & LaTeX support. After editing, I port those highly structured ones into GitBook and some temporal ones into Tumblr (content is written in Markdown, so easy to transfer if needed). 

I tried to build the whole notetaking system with Jupyter notebooks, but failed due to the lack of hierarchy and global search functionality.
